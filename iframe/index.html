    <strong>1.MUSIC IS THE KEY TO CREATIVITY.</strong> <br />
    Music fuels the mind and thus fuels our creativity. A Creative mind has the
    ability to make discoveries and create innovations. The greatest minds and
    thinkers like Albert Einstein, Mozart, and Frank Lloyd Wright all had
    something in common in that they were constantly exploring their imagination
    and creativity. Listening to instrumental music challenges one to listen and
    tell a story about what one hears. In the same sense, playing a musical
    instrument gives you the ability to tell the story without words. Both
    require maximum right brain usage which not only exercises ones creativity
    but also ones intellect. The strength of all the Arts including writing,
    painting, dance, and theater have the ability to create a similar effect.

    <strong>2. MUSIC MAKES EDUCATION MORE ENJOYABLE.</strong> <br />
    Music can be very engaging in the classroom and is a great tool for
    memorization. I’m sure if more teachers used song to teach the
    multiplication tables, kids would retain that information much quicker.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3.MUSIC CAN CREATE A MOOD AND MAKE YOU FEEL EMOTION.</strong> <br />
    Music can whisk you away on an extended journey. Music can make time feel
    frozen. Music also has the power to suggest movement. All these things deal
    with the human senses. I’m sure you can remember a moment where a song has
    made you particularly sad or very excited and happy. But how does organized
    tones create such an effect on our senses? No one really knows why or where
    it comes from but there are many studies that have been done to show that
    there is an agreement of which emotions pertain to certain scales, chords,
    and harmonies.

    <strong>4.Music Brings People Together</strong> <br />
    What is amazing about music is that it is imbedded within all of us.
    Everyone can understand it and feel something if they open themselves up.
    Playing music with other musicians is an incredible feeling. Some people
    describe it as rowing down a river together. There is a certain type of
    connection that comes when you make music in a group. The same is true for
    those who are listening to music in a group and interacting with music
    through Dance. This type of behavior is rooted in our history and our
    discoveries as human beings.
